My web site, based on Gatsby and Sanity.

## Development

Clone and install dependencies with npm, and start a local dev server with `npm run dev`.

The repo is split in two - a `studio` folder and a `web` folder. The `studio` folder contains all schema and plugin code for our CMS - Sanity. The `web` folder contains the Gatsby site that generates the web site.

## Deployment

Both the web site and CMS is deployed to Netlify whenever we merge to master.
